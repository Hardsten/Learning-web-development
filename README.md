# Learning-web-development
Some experiments I did when I was learning the first steps of web development 

Theese codes are not to be used in open public without applying safety actions.
I just wrote theese sites as test-sites to check my knowledge.


One of the sites is a code playground, and a simplyfied JSBin.com replica to test my skills in jQuery.

One other is a bbc replica I did to test my skills in css. The links and menu are not supposed to work.

I also did a reaction-test game to test my skills in javaSqript.
